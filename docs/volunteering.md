## Fundación Peruana de Cancer (FPC)

Teaching kids from the "Fundación Peruana de Cancer (FPC)" how to build games using Scratch. I also helped the foundation connecting things on the website and doing some integration the app of the game "Los Chanchos Vuelan" used to collect funds to help the kids.

I was a volunteer in Lima, Perú through AIESEC sponsored by SENA in 2016.

## Remic

I started an initiative first with some close friends that wanted to learn how to program without studying directly software engineering. We did small projects together where I was the main mentor of the program. I was teaching my friends and participants how to use tools on the day-to-day software programming, as well as guidance for tutorials and resources to learn specific languages.

Later on, I also mentored some students from the University of Medellin. I decided to create a schema for some projects where the students would implement features starting from a design process ending with a release process. At the same time, these projects were going to be open source to help the community mostly from Colombia and other latin american countries. Unfortunately, none of these projects were finished due to the unavailability of myself and the students and the lack of time to further support this.

Some of these projects ideas were:

- A web application to help people finding lost pets.
- A web application to arrange non-professional tournaments. (As in Colombia is very common to arrange these, why not create an app that facilitates the creation).

After I decided to move out from Colombia in 2019, I decided to stop this initiative of creating projects due to the lack of time.

To this day, I continue mentoring close friends and other people who want to switch careers and start working as software developers.

I provide all the guidance and facilitate a path that it's relatively safe for people who are not available full time or do not know exactly which technologies to study. All my guidance is based on up-to-date technologies, which are good to get a first job in tech.

Paths I mentor/teach:

Front-end Development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React)
Back-end Development (Using Node.js, Express and SQL)
Data Science (Python, SQL and foundations)
