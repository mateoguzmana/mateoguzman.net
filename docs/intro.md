# About Me

Hi, I'm Mateo — a Software Engineer with a strong passion for mobile development. I genuinely enjoy writing code (yes, for fun!), which is why I love contributing to [open source](./open-source) and experimenting with various [personal projects](./personal-projects).

Originally from Medellín, Colombia, I now call The Netherlands home. When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me exploring new places. [Traveling](./travelling/) is one of my favorite ways to break out of routine — and living in Europe definitely makes spontaneous getaways a whole lot easier.
