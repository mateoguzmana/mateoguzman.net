# About Me

Hey, I'm Mateo. A Software Engineer with passion for mobile development. I actually can say that I have fun writing code, that's why I try to contribute to [open source](./open-source) as well as getting entertained with my [personal projects](./personal-projects).

As for my personal life, I'm originally from Medell√≠n, Colombia but I currently live in The Netherlands. I like [travelling](./travelling/) and Europe is a good place to be in if you want to escape of your routine all of a sudden.
