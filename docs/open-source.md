In my spare time I try contribute to the open source community by adding new features or fixing bugs to existing repositories but also creating my own open source libraries.

## React Native Maps üó∫Ô∏è

Created an initial [draft](https://github.com/mateoguzmana/react-native-maps/tree/feature/initial-web-support) to give web support. Didn't continue because there was another person with a better approach but it doesn't seem to be up yet. Might continue it when I have time.

## TypeScript Cheat Sheet

I added a very complete example for the usage of [useImperativeHandle](https://github.com/typescript-cheatsheets/react/pull/542), the one in the cheat sheet was very basic.

## React Native Draggable View

I implemented the [inverted draggable view](https://github.com/yaraht17/react-native-draggable-view/pull/14) for react-native-draggable-view.
