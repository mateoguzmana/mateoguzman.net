To get a bit out of my routine and to explore my entrepreneur skills, I have created some projects that have pushed me a bit more towards the business side of software development.

## Xplorer

Xplorer is your ultimate companion for planetary exploration in the multiverse. An application with generated planet textures using Stable Diffusion XL + LoRA [v2]. The client is composed of two parts, a web application using Next.js and ThreeJS for the 3D rendering of the planets. And a mobile application using React Native (Expo), which embeds the 3D from the web and it's connected to emitting web view messages.

## MyPaws

Help millions of pets around the world find a new home. If you've lost yours, we will help you find it.

iOS and Android application made with React Native with a back-end on NestJS and PostgreSQL as database. Also experimenting with React Native Web to create a minimal web version of the app (no separated web code).

## Private Jobs Platform

Jobs posting/finder platform. Using Next.js, React Native and React Native Web to share components across platforms but handling the navigation differently.

## Private Mentoring Program

I have been helping more than 10+ people for more than 3 years to switch from other fields into Software Engineering.

With my private mentoring program I offer calls 1:1 in a weekly basis and a full program to learn how to program while creating a project as well as daily support with questions and helping them not getting stuck in an efficient way.

I was initially doing this for free to some of my friends and university classmates (because when I was in the university I already knew how to program, hence I was supporting them) but later on I started charging for this since it was very effective.

If you are interested about switching careers and you need a personalised mentorship, drop me a message on my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MateoGuzmanA).
